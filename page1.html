    <p>Shanghai belongs to the state of Wu in the spring and Autumn Period [16]. The Warring States period successively belonged to the state of Yue and the state of Chu. During the spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, Shanghai was also called &quot;Shen&quot; because it was the fiefdom of Huang Xie, Chunshen king of Chu. In the Jin Dynasty, because fishermen created fishing tool &quot;Hu&quot;, the place where the river flows into the sea was called &quot;Du&quot;, so the lower reaches of Songjiang River was called &quot;hudu&quot;, and later changed &quot;Hu&quot; to &quot;Hu&quot;, so Shanghai was referred to as &quot;Hu&quot; [17]. In the tenth year of Tianbao period of Tang Dynasty (751 A.D.), Shanghai area belongs to Huating county (now Songjiang District). In the second year of Chunhua of the Northern Song Dynasty (AD 991), due to the continuous silting of the upper reaches of the Songjiang River and the eastward movement of the coastline, it was inconvenient for large ships to get in and out. Therefore, foreign ships had to berth on the &quot;Shanghai Pu&quot; branch of the Songjiang River (its location is from the present Bund to the Huangpu River near the shitupu). In the third year of Xianchun in the Southern Song Dynasty (AD 1267), a town was set up on the West Bank of Shanghai Puxi, named &quot;Shanghai town&quot;. In the 29th year of the Zhiyuan period (1292 A.D.), the central government designated Shanghai town from Huating county and approved the establishment of Shanghai county, marking the beginning of Shanghai's construction.</p>
     <p>Qin and Han Dynasties and later successively belonged to Kuaiji county and Wujun County, respectively belonging to Haiyan County, Youquan county and Louxian county.</p>
     <p>In 751, the prefect of Wu county approved the establishment of Huating County, and Shanghai began to have a relatively independent administrative division. Huating County governs about the south of Wusong River old road in Shanghai area and the west of Chuansha Huinan Datuan line.</p>
     <p>In the Northern Song Dynasty, Shanghai was divided into Huating county and Kunshan County, and Chongming area was Haimen county. In the 10th year of the Xining period of Song Dynasty (1077), Shanghai affairs was set up.</p>
     <p>From the Yuan Dynasty to the 14th year of Yuan Dynasty (1277), Huating county was upgraded to the government, and the next year was renamed Songjiang Prefecture, and Huating county was still subordinate to it. In the 29th year of Zhiyuan (1292), Shanghai county was under the jurisdiction of Songjiang Prefecture. Shanghai county covers an area of about 2000 square kilometers. The county area is about the south of Wusong River old road, most of Qingpu County, most of Minhang District, most of Pudong New Area and Nanhui County. In the late Yuan Dynasty, there were Songjiang Prefecture, Jiading Prefecture and Chongming Prefecture, Huating county and Shanghai county.</p>
     <p>At the end of Ming Dynasty, there were Songjiang Prefecture, Huating County, Shanghai county and Qingpu County, Jiading County and Chongming County, Jinshanwei county.</p>
     <p>In 1726, there were 8 counties in Songjiang Prefecture, including Huating (the place of administration), Lou (the city shared with Huating), Shanghai, Qingpu, Fengxian, Fuquan, Jinshan and Nanhui, and Jiading and Baoshan of Taicang Prefecture. In 1805, the pattern of 10 counties and 1 Department was basically formed in Shanghai, including Huating, Shanghai, Qingpu, Lou, Fengxian, Jinshan, Nanhui, Chuansha Fumin hall, Jiading, Chongming and Baoshan in Taicang Prefecture. In the 15th year of Jiaqing (1810), a total of 600 square kilometers were saved. The county area is about the south of Wusong River old road, most of Pudong New Area and most of Minhang District. The county is located in the ring road of Renmin Road and Zhonghua Road in the original South urban area. In 1843, Shanghai was opened as a port. In 1845, the area to the north of Yangjingbang in Shanghai county was designated as the residence of foreigners, and then the British concession was formed. In 1848, Hongkou was designated as the American concession.</p>
     <p>In January of the first year of the Republic of China (1912), Songjiang Prefecture and Taicang prefecture were cut, and Shanghai was directly under Jiangsu Province, including Shanghai, Huating (later renamed Songjiang), Jiading, Baoshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian, Jinshan, Qingpu, Chongming, etc. In the third year of the Republic of China (1914), Jiangsu Province was divided into five roads, including Shanghai, Songjiang, Nanhui, Qingpu, Fengxian, Jinshan, Chuansha, Jiading, Baoshan, Chongming and Haimen County of Jiangsu Province. In 1925, the Beiyang government allowed Shanghai to be changed into Songhu city. In the 15th year of the Republic of China (1926), sun Chuanfang supervised Jiangsu Province and established Songhu commercial port, which was divided into five districts: Shanghai, Zhabei, Pudong, Huxi and Wusong. On July 7 of the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), Shanghai special city was established and directly under the central government. After the founding of the national government, according to Sun Yat Sen's great Shanghai plan, the national government established Shanghai special city in 1928, which expanded the urban area to include part of Shanghai and Baoshan counties, and set up 17 districts, while the counties in Shanghai area still belonged to Jiangsu Province. Since then, Shanghai City and Shanghai county were separated. The city extends to Pudong in the East, Jing'an Temple and Xujiahui in the west, Longhua in the South and Baoshan Road in the north. [19] In the spring of 1928, Shanghai special city declared the concession a special area. In July, it took over 17 cities and townships of Shanghai, including Shanghai (south of Shanghai), Zhabei, Pusong, Yangjing, Yinxiang port, fahua, Caohejing, Gaohang, Luhang, Tangqiao, Yangsi and Wusong, Yinxing, Jiangwan, Pengpu, Zhenru and Gaoqiao of Baoshan County, which are the actual situation of Shanghai special city, covering an area of 494.69 square kilometers (excluding the concession). In addition, 17 cities and townships were changed to 17 districts, and Shanghai began to have district level construction. Shanghai, Jiading, Baoshan, Songjiang, Chuansha, Qingpu, Nanhui, Fengxian, Jinshan and Chongming counties in Shanghai are still subordinate to Jiangsu Province. In July of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), Shanghai special city was renamed Shanghai city.</p>
     <p>After liberation (May 27, 1949), Shanghai Municipal People's government was established, including 20 districts including Huangpu, laozha, Yimiao, Penglai, Songshan, Luwan, Changshu, Xuhui, Changning, Putuo, Zhabei, Jing'an, Xincheng, Jiangning, Beizhan, Hongkou, Beichuan Road, Tilanqiao, Yangpu, Yulin, etc., and Xinshi, Jiangwan, Wusong, Dachang, Xinjing, Longhua, Yangjing, Zhenru and Gaoqiao Wait for 10 suburbs.
