Shanghai is located in the east of China, the estuary of the Yangtze River and the East China Sea. It connects Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in the north and West. It is bounded by 120 ° 52 ′ - 122 ° 12 ′ E and 30 ° 40 '- 31 ° 53 ′ n. During the Warring States period, Shanghai was the fiefdom of Chun Shen Jun, so it was also called Shen. In the Jin Dynasty, because fishermen created fishing tool "Hu", the place where the river flows into the sea was called "Du", so the area along the lower reaches of Songjiang River was called "hudu", and later changed to "Hu", so Shanghai was referred to as "Hu".
